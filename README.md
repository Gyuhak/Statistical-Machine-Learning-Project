# Stats-ML

We upload our project files here for the NYU course DS-GA 1003 Machine Learning and Computational Statistics. The details of the course can be found here http://davidrosenberg.github.io/ml2016/#home.

Our project goal was to implement standard machine learning techniques such as support vector machine, ensembles etc. to identify the authors of paintings. It was a supervised learning where given pixel information of paintings, we extracted meaningful features by Caffe convolutional network and classified the authors of paintings.

The result shows that it was able to capture the difference between images and identify the authors. It was particularly strong at distinguishing authors between different art movements such as Impressionism and Renaissance. But, it was still able to classify the most similar authors with fair precision.
